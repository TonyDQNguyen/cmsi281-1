cmsi 281: data structures (and algorithms)
==========================================


how to use
----------

This is a github repo for an introductory class on data structures and their implementations and applications.

Follow along with the READMEs to progress through the course.

To get started, clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/jazzyfresh/cmsi281.git jazzyfresh-cmsi281   
```

When doing your version of the assignments, you might want to put your solutions in a separate github repo called cmsi281-solutions
(the reason for this is so to not have overlapping project names if you fork jazzyfresh/cmsi281) but any repo you want
really is fine.

To copy project stub files to your repo:

```
cp jazzyfresh-cmsi281/josephus/*.java cmsi281-solutions/
```
